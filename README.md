### Step 1 : Before setup, you need to know what is Web Scraping...

</div>

- **Read more : [About of Web Scraping](https://viettelidc.com.vn/tin-tuc/web-scraping-la-gi?utm_term=&utm_campaign=GG_PMAX_PAYG&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5671991650&hsa_cam=20917067474&hsa_grp=&hsa_ad=&hsa_src=x&hsa_tgt=&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAl4a6BhBqEiwAqvrqutp89GE_mGTtIlkIkALr_Hu5dWhMliKlBbdypHiV9GL72CRA3XVhbBoC32UQAvD_BwE)**

### Step 2 : After completing the setup file, please ensure that the ```install_env.bat``` file is automatically allowed to run

<div align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bc829d2-41a9-493a-933d-f4298ec2867b" />
</div>

- This batch file is crucial for automatically setting up the environment for my script.
- And always ensure that the process is never terminated while running. Doing so can cause cache conflicts...

<div align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64d626e6-e960-405f-9232-4f5d55929f64" />
</div>

- And after waiting about 1-2 minutes for the environment setup to complete, you can exit this batch file as shown in the image.

<div align="center">

</div>

### Step 3 : Are you experiencing the issue shown in the image where the ```Dynamic Content Scraping``` feature cannot run?

<div align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9144e69-4856-4e46-910e-e4bc09a81899" />
</div>

- Below are the steps to fix this error:

#### 1. Press the ```Windows + R``` key combination, then type ```%appdata%```.

<div align="center">

</div>

---

#### 2. Locate the folder to apply the fix.
- In the ```URLScraper``` application, if the ```Dynamic Content Scraping``` feature doesn't work because the file shown in the image is missing, the solution is to locate the folder specified in the script and apply the necessary fix.

<div align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d10c7037-8758-4ada-8a5d-03f9a29bc31e" />
</div>

- Next, navigate to the Chromium folder located in the path shown in the image, then press ```Ctrl + C``` to copy the entire folder.

<div align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f8b1062-1386-4d0c-b2b0-1e0db813649f" />
</div>

<div align="center">
<h5>âš Warningâš  : Since each device requires its own specific Chromium folder, pay close attention to this part. What I'm demonstrating here is just an example, and there is a high chance it may not match your setup exactly, so it's important to understand this step thoroughly.</h5>
</div>


---

#### 3. Next, go to the path shown in the image below. 
- If you see a folder named ```.local-browsers```, paste the copied Chromium folder into it. If the folder doesn't exist, create a new ```.local-browsers``` folder and then paste the Chromium folder into it.

<img src = "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c24e964-3f00-4887-b79a-421d1558fb45" />
</div>

<div align="center">
<h5>âš Warningâš  : Always keep in mind that if the script reports an error in a specific Chromium folder path, you must apply the fix precisely to that location. Also, pay close attention to ensure you are modifying the correct "_MEII" folder within the "Temp" directory to avoid further confusion or mistakes.</h5>
</div>
